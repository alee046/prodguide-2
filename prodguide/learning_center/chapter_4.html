         <p>Pen Vaporizers (also referred to as vape pens or pen vapes) are super-slim and ultra-discreet. Like their name suggests, these units resemble pens used for writing in both shape and size. While pen vaporizers do offer a quick and easy way to enjoy herbs and wax, it’s important to understand that these units use exposed coils to heat material through conduction – not convection. Because pen vaporizers heat using conduction, they’re not considered “true vaporizers”, as in most cases, the material is coming into direct contact with the heating coil and combusting, thus creating smoke – not vapor.</p>
         <p>Even though pen vaporizers are portable, in the sense that they can easily be taken with you on-the-go, they’re do not fall into the classification of being a true portable vaporizer due to the fact that heat material through conduction, causing combustion which results in smoke.</p>
         <p>Pen-style vaporizers are most commonly used for concentrates (wax and waxy oils) and e-juice. Herb pens are also popular; however, due to the heating method (conduction) that most vape pens utilize, people looking for a unit that produces minimal combustion tend to lean towards portable handheld units, as they heat material by conduction. However, herb pens are a great choice for those looking for the quickest and simplest means of vaporization.</p>
         <p>Let’s take a look at the different types of pen-style vaporizers and what makes each unique.</p>

      <div class="section_title">Types of Pen Vaporizers</div>
      <div class="section_data">
         <p>Pen vaporizers fall into one of four categories depending on the material they are designed to be used with: <b>Herb Pens, Wax Pens, E-Juice Pens</b> (also called e-cigs) or <b>Multifunction</b> (if the pen can be used with multiple materials.</p>
         <p><b>Herb Pens:</b> Used for dry material, the pens typically hold a “pinch” of herb and utilize a flat or vertical coil heat source (atomizer). Herb pens offer a fast, simple and discreet way to vape. Most commonly, dry material is loaded into the pen’s herb chamber, which contains a heating coil. Once activated, the coil warms up, which then heats your buds through direct contact. While some units include atomizers that prevent the herb from actually touching the heating coil, in most cases, herb pens utilize conduction heating - which in turn leads to some a certain degree of combustion. While herb pens do not truly “vaporize,” they’re very popular among those looking for a quick, easy and low-key way to enjoy their herbs.</p>
         <p><b>E-Juice Pens:</b> Arguably the most popular type of pen vaporizer, vape pens used for e-juice are widely recognized as a safer alternative to smoking traditional cigarettes, and are used as a tool to help people quit smoking. These pens utilize a tank that is filled with flavored e-juice that contains varying levels of nicotine. The e-juice is loaded into a tank called a clearomizer. This clearomizer houses the pen’s heating element, or atomizer. The atomizer has a wick, which absorbs the e-juice as it sits in the tank, which is then heated by the atomizer once activated. E-juice pens are gaining a lot of popularity around the globe, as studies have shown them to be a far healthier alternative to smoking cigarettes.</p> 
         <p><b>Multifunction Pens:</b> Pens that include multiple attachments (chambers, atomizers) that allow them to be used with more than one material are referred to as multifunction units. These pens are very versatile, but typically aren’t has high-quality as units that are designed for one specific material.</p>

      <div class="section_title">Parts of a Pen Vaporizer</div>
      <div class="section_data">
         <p>Vape Pens typically consist of three sections: a <b>battery</b>, a <b>chamber</b> or <b>tank</b> (which houses the <b>atomizer</b>) and a <b>mouthpiece</b>. Most pen vaporizer parts feature universal 510 threading, allowing for cross-compatibility between multiple different devices – meaning a chamber or tank designed for one vape pen will work with the battery of another.</p>
         <p><b>Battery:</b> The battery of a pen vaporizer is what powers the heating element. Vape pen batteries are typically charged by way of USB, and some even offer voltage/temperature control.</p>
         <p><b>Heating Chamber/Tank: </b> The area in which material is loaded is called the chamber or tank (depending on the type of pen). This is also the section of the pen vaporizer which houses the heating element (atomizer).</p>
         <p><b>Atomizer: </b> The heating element of a pen vaporizer is called an atomizer. There are many different types of atomizers used for heating different types of materials, but all typically consist of a wire or coil which becomes hot when the power button on the battery is pressed.</p>
         <p><b>Mouthpiece:</b> The mouthpiece is the section of the vape pen which you inhale through.</p>

      <div class="section_title">How do Pen Vaporizers Work?</div>
      <div class="section_data">
      <p>All pen vaporizer function in pretty much the same way. For starters, most all pen vaporizers feature a 5-click locking mechanism that requires the user to press the power button five times consecutively in order to unlock the battery. This security features is to prevent accidental firing of the unit while in your pocket. At this point, you’ll see and LED light behind the power button flash to indicate that the unit is on and ready to be used.</p>
      <p>Unlike portable vaporizers which heat-up to a set temperature and stay at a constant heat once turned on, pen vaporizers require the user to manually active the heating coil by pressing the power button during each draw. Once activated, the heating coil or atomizer heats the desired material and creates vapor/smoke, which is then inhaled.</p>

      <div class="section_title">Advantages of Pen Vaporizers</div>
      <div class="section_data">
      <p>Because the heating element of a pen vaporizer is only activated when the power button is being pressed, pen vapes give the user more control over their vaporization experience when compared to a true portable vaporizer – which heats-up and stays at a constant temperature for the duration of the session. With a vape pen, you can take a quick draw and then save the rest of the material packed in the chamber for later.</p>
      <p>The most obvious advantage of vape pens is their size. No larger than an average pen you would use to write with, pen vaporizers are small and slim enough to fit into any pocket, purse or bag, allowing them to be taken pretty much anywhere. This isn’t always the case with true portable vaporizers, as they can be a bit bulky and less discreet than pens.</p>
      <p>Lastly, as opposed to portable vaporizers which can take anywhere from 30 seconds to over a minute to heat to a desired temperature, vape pens heat material instantly, allowing the user to pull them out and take a draw quickly and discreetly.</p>

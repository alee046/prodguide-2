         <h3>Hot Lead (HL) process can be broken up into three stages.</h3>
			<ol>
            <li>Contact lead inquiry within <b>5 hours</b> of assigned time. (If assigned after 8pm, clock will begin at 8am of the next business day) The Account Executive (AE) has <b>5 hours</b> to contact the HL after the customer's initial inquiry.</li>
            <li>Obtain Sales Order within <b>14 days</b> of the customerâ€™s initial inquiry.The AE is expected to convert the lead into a customer(Account) by obtaining an order. ("Shortened sales cycle")</li>

   The AE is expected to have filled in the appropriate mandatory fields in "Store Qualification" details section in Zoho
   and update the Lead Status by following the guide on page 3.</li>
         </ol>

      <div style="display:none;" class="section_data">
      <p>Hot leads qualification management audit will be conducted by Operations to ensure that both <b>5 hour</b> initial contact and <b>14 day order compliance</b> are met. The goal is to ensure a timely response via phone (preferably) or email to wholesale inquiries. Validations for fields that are required have been set up through tracking via Zoho reporting. Calls will be verified by Shoretel and confirmed by way of reaching out to each inquiry by phone and conducting a customer survey. Any failures to meet requirements will result in suspension of new leads for periods ranging from 1- 3 months and or disciplinary action.</p>
